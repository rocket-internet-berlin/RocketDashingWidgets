# Rocket DashingWe occasionally use [Shopify's](https://www.shopify.com/) excellent [Dashing](http://dashing.io/) framework for headline system monitoring.This is a collection of jobs and widgets with a sample dashboard that we've found helpful.## Running it...To use this sample, you should... * Install bundler: `gem install bundler --no-rdoc --no-ri`. * Install dependencies using bundler: `bundle`. * Copy config.ru.example to config.ru: `cp config.ru.example config.ru`. * Edit config.ru to include the various credentials you need and remove the configs you won't use. * Run dashing: `dashing start`. * Take a look in your browser at *http://0.0.0.0:3030/dashing/*.We found [this article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-rails-apps-using-unicorn-and-nginx-on-centos-6-5) helpful for deploying using Unicorn & nginx.*This has been configured to run under the "/dashing/" URI*. To change this, read [this simple how-to](https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/How-To%3A-Run-dashing-on-a-sub-path).## The code...Real documentation on how Dashing expects dashboards to be structured is [here](http://dashing.io/#setup) but for quick reference...  * `assets` - CSS, CoffeeScript etc largel generated by the Dashing generator. * `dashboards` - Named dashboards. Here we have "sample.erb", which means you can go to "http://0.0.0.0:3030/dashing/sample/". Dashing scans this directory and generates the available dashboards URIs based on the filenames. * `jobs` - Background jobs that run and collect data. * `lib` - Helpful libraries (e.g. managing config variables). * `public` - Static files (e.g. favicon.ico). * `widgets` - HTML/CSS/CoffeeScript for the presentation widgets (e.g. we've added [Simplemon](https://github.com/roidelapluie/dashing-scripts/tree/master/widgets/simplemon) in here).## Thanks!Thanks for easy dashboardery... * [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) for building [Dashing](http://dashing.io/). * The Icinga job is only slightly modified from [dashing-icinga](https://github.com/lazyfrosch/dashing-icinga).
